# Privacy Policy for SourceLens

**Last updated:** [Date]

## Overview

SourceLens ("we", "our", "the extension") is committed to protecting your privacy. This extension is designed to enhance your experience with AI chat interfaces while maintaining the highest standards of privacy and data protection.

## Data Collection

**We do not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal data or chat content.**

The extension operates entirely locally on your device and makes no network requests except those required by your browser to load the extension itself.

## What Data is Stored Locally

SourceLens stores the following data **only on your device** using Chrome's local storage:

### 1. Settings
- Panel position preference
- Default view settings
- Display preferences (theme, snippet length, etc.)
- Privacy preferences

### 2. Pinned Sources (Optional)
If you choose to pin sources:
- URLs of pinned sources
- Titles and domains (extracted from visible page elements)
- User-entered notes (you provide these explicitly)
- Folder/collection organization
- Timestamps (when pinned, last seen)

**We do NOT store:**
- ChatGPT message text
- Your prompts or questions
- Assistant responses
- Any chat conversation content

### 3. Session History (Optional, can be disabled)
If enabled in settings:
- Result counts per session
- Domain names (e.g., "wikipedia.org", "bbc.com")
- Hashed identifiers (not readable chat IDs)
- Timestamps

**We do NOT store:**
- Chat conversation text
- Full URLs from history (only domain names)
- User prompts
- Assistant responses

### 4. Cached Metadata (Technical)
- URL metadata cache (URL, title, domain) for performance
- Maximum 200 entries (automatically managed)
- LRU (Least Recently Used) eviction

## What Data is NOT Stored

We explicitly do NOT store:
- ✅ ChatGPT message text
- ✅ Your prompts or questions
- ✅ Assistant responses
- ✅ Your ChatGPT account information
- ✅ Personal information
- ✅ Browsing history outside of extension usage
- ✅ Any data that could identify you personally

## Data Transmission

**No data is transmitted from your device.**

The extension:
- Does not make network requests
- Does not use analytics or telemetry
- Does not send data to external servers
- Does not communicate with third-party services

All processing happens locally in your browser.

## Third-Party Services

SourceLens does not use any third-party services, analytics platforms, or external APIs. The extension is completely self-contained.

## Data Deletion

You can delete your data at any time:

1. **Clear Pins** - Settings → Privacy Controls → Clear Pins
2. **Clear History** - Settings → Privacy Controls → Clear History
3. **Clear Cache** - Settings → Privacy Controls → Clear Derived Caches
4. **Clear All Data** - Settings → Privacy Controls → Clear All Data
5. **Complete Reset** - Settings → Privacy Controls → Reset Everything

Uninstalling the extension will also remove all stored data (Chrome automatically clears extension storage on uninstall).

## Permissions

### Storage Permission
Required to save your preferences and pinned sources locally on your device.

### Host Permissions (chatgpt.com, chat.openai.com)
Required to inject the results panel overlay on these specific domains only. The extension does not access any other websites.

## Children's Privacy

SourceLens does not knowingly collect information from children. As the extension does not collect any personal information, this is not applicable.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. The "Last updated" date at the top will reflect when changes were made. Continued use of the extension after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.

## Contact

For questions about this privacy policy or data handling practices, please contact: [your-email@example.com]

## Compliance

This privacy policy is compliant with:
- Chrome Web Store Developer Program Policies
- General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
- California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)

**Summary:** SourceLens stores only minimal local preferences and pinned source metadata. We never collect, transmit, or share your chat content or personal information. All data processing happens locally on your device.
